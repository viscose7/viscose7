✦ onthaline ✦
     could be the best optimizer for win10/win11 
---------------------------------------------------
its a batch file, open source but its make best opt
for windows. i tested on older pc's and newer pc's

if you optimized your pc with onthaline, and after
you need more/stable fps, i recommend to you to
overclock your gpu/cpu or upgrade ur spec's

---------------------------------------------------
i highly recommend to reinstall your pc before you
try "onthaline"
---------------------------------------------------
without reinstall.
put the "files" and "onthaline.cmd" to
C:\Windows\Setup\Scripts

---------------------------------------------------
with reinstall.
just download the zip
and put the sources and autounattend.xml on the usb
after install just go to the C:\Windows\Setup\Scripts
